# PEN-BOOK-DETECTION
This project involved using a model to detect pens and books in images. Using a pre-annotated dataset where pens and books were marked with bounding boxes, we trained the YOLOv8 model to recognize and locate these items. We evaluated the model's accuracy using a confusion matrix.

The model can be used for various applications, such as organizing and cataloging educational materials, managing inventory, and enhancing educational tools by automatically recognizing and sorting pens and books in images. This project highlights the potential of object detection techniques to streamline the management of academic and office supplies.
